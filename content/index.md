# The Patterns
> A pattern language has the structure of a network.
> [...]
> The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.
> -- p. xviii

---

## Town Patterns
> We begin with that part of the language which defines a town or community. These patterns can never be _designed_ or _built_ in one fell swoop -- but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it.
> -- p. xix

## Building Patterns
>This completes the global patterns which define a town or community. We now start that part of the language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be "designed" or "built" -- the patterns which define the individual buildings and spaces between buildings; where we are dealing for the first time with patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once.
> -- p. xxv 

### Group of Buildings
The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main parking areas, and lines of movement through the complex;

95. [[Building Complex (95) | Building Complex]]

103. [[Small Parking Lots (103) | Small Parking Lots]]

---

### Siting the Buildings
Fix the position of individual buildings on the site, within the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the site, the trees, the sun: this one of the most important moments in the language;

---

### Building Layout
Within the buildings' wings, lay out the entrances, the gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of the buildings and the volume of the space between the buildings at the same time -- remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang, must always get their shape together;

126. [[Something Roughly in the Middle (126) | Something Roughly in the Middle]]

---

### Light and Space
Now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the buildings: within the various wings of any one building, work out the fundamental gradients of space, and decide how the movement will connect the spaces in the gradients;

127. [[Intimacy Gradient (127) | Intimacy Gradient]]

## Construction Patterns
> At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual building. If you have followed the patterns given, you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of the rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid out.
> The next, and last part of the language, tells how to make a building directly from this rough scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail.
> -- p. xxxii

### Emergent Structure
